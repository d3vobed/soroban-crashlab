//! Cooperative run lifecycle and cancellation for long-running fuzz campaigns.
//!
//! Runs check [`CancelSignal`] between iterations so maintainers can stop work
//! gracefully. The same signal can be driven in-process ([`CancelSignal::new`])
//! or via [`request_cancel_run`] / [`cancel_requested`] when the runner and the
//! `crashlab run cancel` CLI use a shared state directory.
//!
//! Use [`drive_run_partitioned`] with [`crate::worker_partition::WorkerPartition`] to
//! execute only the seed indices assigned to one worker while preserving the same

//!
//! Partitioned workers record progress as ring coverage
//! ([`crate::worker_partition::RingCoverage`]) rather than as a modulo cursor, so
//! resuming with a different worker count neither re-executes covered seeds nor
